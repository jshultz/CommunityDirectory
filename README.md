CommunityDirectory
==================

This was a a platform I built about eight years ago. It was designed to quickly replicate to small communities allowing local businesses to have a small presence. The theory was that businesses could have a SEO friendly page with commericials and videos and photos on their page. With a multitude of small businesses together in one place, it'd draw traffic on google and allow for a marketplace of businesses to get their presence in front of vistors to the area. It wasn't specifically geared to cities smaller then 100k in size.

The site was built on CodeIgniter.

I had cranked out about five sites and chained them together in Arizona and they did ok.
