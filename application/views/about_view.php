  <p>Welcome To Sedona Arizona is your site for finding information about top restaurants, businesses, and entertainment in Camp Verde, Arizona.</p>
<p>I’ve been working on this project for almost a year. It’s a community directory site targeted towards small communities where the primary source of income is Tourism. Websites like this benefit businesses because it allows for a pooling of resources. Business profiles are interconnected using keywords that people would use when searching for businesses in the area. With companies joining together and adding their business profiles, they add to the content of the site and increase the site’s relevance in Google.</p>
<p>There are many community directory sites on the Internet. It is my belief that none offer the features or the search engine optimized content that ours does.  <a href="http://welcometocampverde.com" rel="nofollow" title="Welcome To Sedona Arizona: Shopping and Tourism" target="_blank">Welcome To Jerome – Shopping and Tourism</a>features integrated maps, video, and photo galleries all included so business owners have the best selection of features available.</p>
<p>More features will be coming soon so keep checking back for more updates!</p>
